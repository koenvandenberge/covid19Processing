The required data files can be downloaded on Zenodo using [this link](https://zenodo.org/record/3922319).
To run the code, create a `data` directory in the root of the repository, and store the objects there.

The Zenodo upload contains both the objects required as input to the script in this repository, as well as its output (these objects have the text `_processed` as suffix).
